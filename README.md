# Split the bill
Split the bill is a web application designed to help with group shoppings. It provides a simple user interface that allows groups of people to plan purchases together for a given occasion (e.g. a family vacation, a friend's birthday party, a trip). The application then provides both a summary of the numbers and prices of each item purchased, as well as an overall summary of who bought what. It then allows the cost of the purchase to be shared fairly among the group members.
